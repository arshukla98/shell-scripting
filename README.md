### Tips for Learning Shell Scripting
- **Practice Regularly**: Write and run scripts daily to reinforce learning.
- **Refer to Documentation**: Use `man` pages and online resources to understand command options and syntax.
- **Collaborate and Seek Help**: Work with peers, join forums, or seek help when stuck.
- **Build Projects**: Apply learning by building small projects or automating tasks.

By following this roadmap, new joiners can systematically build their shell scripting skills, progressing from basic to advanced topics.
