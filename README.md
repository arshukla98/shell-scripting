### Tips for Learning Shell Scripting
- **Practice Regularly**: Write and run scripts daily to reinforce learning.
- **Refer to Documentation**: Use `man` pages and online resources to understand command options and syntax.
- **Collaborate and Seek Help**: Work with peers, join forums, or seek help when stuck.
- **Build Projects**: Apply learning by building small projects or automating tasks.

By following this roadmap, new joiners can systematically build their shell scripting skills, progressing from basic to advanced topics over six weeks.
